# Breast_Cancer_Classification-Decision-Tree

## Overview
This project is focused on classifying breast cancer as either benign or malignant using machine learning techniques. Breast cancer classification is a critical step in determining the severity of a detected tumor, aiding in treatment decisions. This project aims to develop a reliable model to assist healthcare professionals in accurately classifying breast cancer cases.

## Introduction
Breast cancer is a complex disease with various subtypes, and timely classification of tumors as benign or malignant is crucial for appropriate medical interventions. This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to develop a robust classification model for accurate breast cancer diagnosis.. The model employs " Decision Tree Classifier " to make predictions based on the input features.

## Results
The model's performance on the test set is as follows:

Accuracy: 95.6%  
Precision: 96%  
Recall: 96%  
F1 Score: 96%
